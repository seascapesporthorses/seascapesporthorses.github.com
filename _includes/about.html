        Charis Dankert established Seascape Sport Horses in 2016 at the Bonny Doon Equestrian Park. The initial focus of the business was the importation and sale of European sport horses. After several successful sales, the business expanded to include a riding lesson program and client horses in training. Shannon Wilson joined the team in early 2017 as business partner and trainer.

We have a close knit barn family and strive to provide our clients and their horses with impeccable care, training and attention. Providing our riders and their horses with the skills and encouragement they need to be the best they can be at any level is our top priority.

        Charis has had a love of horses her entire life. Her decision to pursue a professional career in the industry came while riding as a junior on the A-Circuit at the Pebble Beach Equestrian Center under trainer Tracy Cotchett.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charis attended the University of Findlay in Ohio, where she completed two baccalaureate programs in Equestrian Studies and Equine Business. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in 2008. She participated on the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) team and competed in the equitation and jumper divisions for Findlay's rated show team. Following graduation, she worked in Virginia where she fell in love with the hunters. It was here she was introduced to importing and working with young horses and inspired by the high levels of sportsmanship and professionalism. She was thrilled to compete at Upperville, Loudoun Benefit, HITS Culpeper, and the Kentucky Horse Park, where she observed some of the best hunter riders in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning to California, Charis worked as an assistant trainer for several professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area, while also being employed as a licensed RVT ICU Veterinary technician for an emergency animal hospital in Santa Cruz. In 2016, Charis established Seascape Sport Horses with a focus on importing European horses while developing specialized training programs for both horse and rider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charis strives for impeccable planning, preparation, and safety for both horse and rider. The happiness and well-being of every horse remains at the center of all her professional goals.

        Shannon grew up in San Diego with a love of horses that began at a very young age. Her first lesson at 8 years old quickly turned into weekly lessons and then grew into a lifelong passion. As a junior rider she was guided by Pat Lautenbach of Newmarket Farms in Del Mar and found success in the Equitation and Medal classes. She owes her love of the sport to Pat and feels extremely lucky to have had such an amazing trainer during her junior career. Coming from limited funds, she worked summers and groomed at shows to help afford her riding. She was given amazing riding opportunities on horses that taught her many important lessons both in and out of the show ring.
      </p>
      <p>
        During college she took time off from the horse world to focus on her studies and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Geographic Information Science with a minor in Computer Science from San Diego State University. An internship at the USGS in Menlo Park moved her up north to the Bay Area. During her days off she began riding for a local trainer which reignited the spark all over again. Deciding to follow her true passion in life, she quit her internship and worked as an Assistant Trainer for many of the top show barns in the Bay Area. She has found success in the show ring as a professional in the hunters and jumpers on the A-circuit in Northern California. In 2016 her former colleague and good friend, Charis Dankert, began Seascape Sport Horses. It was a natural fit for Shannon to join SSH in January 2017 as business partner and trainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shannon brings her love of horses and positive personality to each horse and student she works with. She believes that a systematic, enjoyable and customized training schedule brings out the best in horse and rider. Seeing a young rider or young horse learn a new skill and become more confident in their abilities is one her favorite parts of the job.
