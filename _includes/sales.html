          <p>Multiple Championships in the baby green divisions at Woodside Spring and Summer horse shows. Shown by a 13 year old in the 2'6 equitation with great ribbons. 4 year old, Pop Style, AKA Bowie, was imported from Holland in June 2016. Bowie is a beautiful hunter prospect by acclaimed stallion Bustique. He is currenlty 16hh but will continue to grow. Coursing 2'9- 3ft with flying changes. Incredibly calm and easygoing personality and not spooky. Very safe for a junior or amateur! He will have an amazing future in the hunters and will make and excellent small junior hunter / derby horse.
