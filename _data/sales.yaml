  description: Mimosa is an incredibly brave and honest mare that will jump from absolutely anywhere. Imported from France, with experience up to 1.30m. Currently showing with her amateur owner in the 1.10-1.15. Ready to teach someone in the jumpers up to the 1.20s. Can double in the jumper medals as well. Great flatwork, very comfortable and a super fun ride! Not marish at all, very easy to have around the barn.

#   description: Multiple Championships in the baby green divisions at Woodside, Sacramento International and Paso Robles. Has also won multiple large open training hunter classes. Shown by a beginner in the long stirrup at Paso Robles with great ribbons. Coming 5 year old, Pop Style, AKA Bowie, was imported from Holland in June 2016. Bowie is a beautiful hunter prospect by acclaimed stallion Bustique. He is currently 16 hands but will continue to grow. Coursing 3ft with flying changes. Incredibly calm and easygoing personality and not spooky. Very safe and forgiving for a junior or amateur! He will have an amazing future in the hunters and will make and excellent Junior Hunter/Derby Horse. Pop Style's price will increase with training and show experience.
